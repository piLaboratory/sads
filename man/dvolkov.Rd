\title{Neutral Biodiversity Theory distribution by Volkov \emph{et al.} }

\description{Density, distribution function, quantile function and random generation
  for species abundances distribution in a neutral community with
  immigration as deduced by Volkov et al. (2003).
}

\usage{
dvolkov( x, theta, m, J, order=96, log = FALSE )
pvolkov( q, theta, m , J, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE )
qvolkov( p, theta, m, J, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE )
rvolkov( n, theta, m, J)
Svolkov( theta, m, J, order=96)
}

\arguments{
  
  \item{x}{
    vector of (non-negative integer) quantiles. In the context of
    species abundance distributions, this is a
    vector of abundance of species in a sample.
  }

  \item{q}{vector of (non-negative integer) quantiles. In the context of
    species abundance distributions, a vector of abundance of species in a sample.
  }
  \item{n}{number of random values to return.}
  \item{p}{
    vector of probabilities.
  }

  \item{theta}{
    positive real, theta > 0; Hubbell's \sQuote{fundamental biodiversity number}.
  }
  \item{order}{
	  order of the approximation for the numerical integration. The default of 96
	  usually gives a rounding error of 1e-8 for moderate dataset; 
	  orders greater than 128 are probably overkill
  }
  \item{m}{
    positive real, 0 <= m <= 1; immigration rate (see details).
  }
  
  \item{J}{
    positive integer; sample size.  In the context of
    species abundance distributions, usually the number of individuals in a sample.
  }
  
  \item{log, log.p}{
    logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).
  }
  
  \item{lower.tail}{
    logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X <= x],
    otherwise, P[X > x].
  }
  
}

\value{
  \code{dvolkov} gives the (log) density of the density, \code{pvolkov} gives the (log)
  distribution function, \code{qvolkov} gives the (log) the quantile function.
  
  Invalid values for parameters \code{J} or \code{theta} will result in return
  values \code{NaN}, with a warning.

\details{
  Volkov \emph{et al} (2003) proposed one of the analytic solutions for the
  species abundance distributions (SADs)
  for The Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (Hubbell 2001).

  Their solution is deduced from a model of stochastic dynamics of a
  set of species where the following rules apply:
  (1) replacement of a dead individual by local offspring -- with probability 1-m,
  individuals picked at random
  are replaced by the offspring of other individuals picked at random;
  (2) replacement of a dead individual by an immigrant --
  with probability m individuals picked at random
  are replaced by immigrants taken at random from a pool
  of potential colonizers (the metacommunity).

  Volkov et al. (2003, eq.7) provide the stationary solution for
  the expected number
  of species with a given abundance.
  A probability density function is easily calculated by taking
  these expected values for abundances 1:J and dividing them
  by the total number of
  species.
  \code{dvolkov} performs the numerical integration of the 
  density function by means of Gaussian quadrature, using a
  library by Pavel Holoborodko (http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/?page_id=679).
  The code is based on the \code{untb::volkov} function (Hankin 2007).
  \code{pvolkov} provides CDF by
  cumulative sum of density values, and \code{qvolkov} use
  a numeric interpolation with a step function (\code{approxfun})
  to find quantiles.
  Calculations can be slow for larger datasets.

  A special function Svolkov is provided to estimate the expected community size from a Volkov distribution with parameters theta, m and J, but this function is deprecated. A more comprehensive function to estimate community sizes will be developed in the future.
