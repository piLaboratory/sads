\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    Vector of (non-negative integer) quantiles. Usually a vector of
    abundances of species in a sample.
  }
  \item{alpha}{
    Fisher's alpha parameter (see details)
  }
  \item{log}{
    logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p)
  }
}

\details{

  The Fisher logseries is a limiting case of the Negative Binomial where
  the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial tends to zero. It
  was originally proposed by Fisher (1943) to relate the expected number
  of species in a sample from a biological community to the sample size as:

  S = alpha * log(1 + N/alpha)

  Where alpha is the single parameter of the logseries distribution,
  often used as a diversity index. From this relation follows that the expected number of species with x
  individuals in the sample is
  
  S(x) = alpha*X^x/x

  Where X is a function of alpha and N, that tends to one as the sample
  size N increases:

  X = N / (alpha+ N)
  
  In ecology, this distribution gives the probability that a species has an abundance of x individuals in a random sample of size N of the community. In the community the species abundances are independent random variables that follow a logseries distribution. Thus, a random sample of a logseries is also a logseries distribution.
  
  Hence, a logseries distribution is a model for species
  abundances distributions (SAD) under the assumptions that (a) species
  abundances in the community are independent identically distributed
  logseries variables, (b) sampling is a Poisson proccess with expected
  value , (c) the sampling is with replacement, or the fraction
  sampled is small enough to approximate a sample with replacement.
