\details{

  The Broken-stick distribution was proposed as a rank-abundance model
  (rad, see \code{\link{fitrad-class}})
  in community ecology (MacArthur 1960).
  According to this model, the
  expected abundance of a given species in a sample taken from a
  community is:

  n(i) = N/S (sum(from k=i to S) 1/k)

  where n(i) is the abundance in the i-th most abundant species (May
  1975). Hence the probability (or expected proportion of individuals)
  in the i-th species is

  p(i) = n(i)/N = n(i) = (sum(from k=i to S) 1/k) / S

  \code{fitrbs} fits this rad model to a vector of species abundances,
  or to a rank-abundace table of the class \code{\link{rad}}.

  The probability density for a given abundance value
  in the Broken-stick model is 

  p(x) = (1 - x/N)^(S-2) (S - 1)/N

  
  Where x is the abundance of a given species in the sample (May 1975).
  This expression can be used as
  species abundance model (sad). 
  see \code{\link{fitsad-class}}.
  \code{fitbs} fits this sad model to a vector of species abundances.
    
  The Broken-stick distribution describes the expected
  lengths of a stick broken at S-1 random points.
  It was originally proposed as a null model
  for resource paritioning among similar species in a community
  (MacArthur 1960). It depends only on the observed number of
  elements S in the collection and collection size N.
  Therefore, once a sample is taken,
  the Broken-stick has no free parameters.

  Therefore, there is no actual "fitting", but still
  the functions call
  \code{mle2} from package 'bbmle' with
  fixed parameters N and S and \code{eval.only=TRUE}
  to return an object of classes \code{fitsad}
  or \code{fitrad} to keep compatibility with other
  sad and rad models fitted to the same data.
  Therefore the resulting objects allows most of the
  operations with sad or rad models, such as
  comparison with other models through model selection,
  diagnostic plots and so on
  (see \code{\link{fitsad-method}} and \code{\link{fitsad-method}} 
}

\value{
  \code{fitbs} returns an object fo class 'fitsad'.
  \code{fitrbs} returns an object fo class 'fitrad'.
