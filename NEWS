0.4.2 (2018-06-16)

* fixed bug that does not allow zero values in non-truncated poilog, geom, nbinom
* fix: diagnostic octav plot Plot #1 returned by plot methods for fitsad and fitrad methods had a truncated bar for the first octave.
* sads-package.Rd updated to be syncronized with package metadata
* rsads now allows a numeric vector in argument 'sads', to define an arbitrary community to be sampled

0.4.1 (2017-10-17)
* fixed fitpareto to have 2 degrees of freedom
* added Svolkov function
* removed deprecated "representation" from class definitions
* removed some checks for bugs in previous bbmle versions

0.4.0 (2017-06-11)
* added a "prop" argument for plotting relative rank abundances
* changed many details in plotting functions related to above change
* fixed registering external calls for R version 3.4
* fixed qbs not accepting non-integer N
* added continuous integration tests with TravisCI/AppVeyor
* added clarifications for building vignettes on README
* fixed a bug where plotprofmle would ignore input parameters
* tweaked fitgeom optimization a bit

0.3.1 (2016-05-12)
* Fixed a CRAN link on README

0.3.0 (2016-05-11)
* new functions for density, distribution, quantile and random generators function for the Pueyo's powerbend distribution
* several new functionalities for random sad generation (rsad)
* now providing random generator functions for all distributions in the package (such as rls, rmzsm, rzipf, etc)
* octav is now a S4 method, and octav plots have a new argument "mid=TRUE"
* new function and class for likelregions; also changed the spline method for plotting in plotprofmle
* better optimization and vectorization of several discrete quantile and distribution functions
* fixed the support of Zipf, Zipf-Mandelbrot and geometric series to not include zero abundances or zero-th rank
* added He & Tang's formula for initial parameter estimate of the geometric series
* more robust checking for invalid data in the fitting functions
* fixed bugs in octav, octavpred and dmzsm

0.2.4 (2015-11-02)
* octavpred now accepts a 'preston' argument (as does 'octav')
* fixes a bug in fitvolkov under Windows
* added a friendlier error message when the octavs provided in octavpred do not cover the data
* deprecated the slot "distr" on fitsad/fitrad objects. Now users should use the `distr` function (see ?distr)
* fixed signature errors on several methods dealing with the `trunc` parameter
* now providing the coefficients, fitted, fitted.values, residuals methods on fitsad/fitrad methods
* providing a summary method for fitsad/fitrad classes that allows for fixed parameters (such as produced by fitls, fitvolkov, etc)

0.2.3 (2015-09-24)
* fitgeom, fitpoilog and fitnbinom now can get argument trunc=NULL to avoid zero-truncation (the default)
* fitgeom uses default optimization method from mle2 instead of Brent's method, to avoid some overflow errors for large datasets (e.g. moths)
* dmzsm and dvolkov now returns zero for any abundance larger than the community size J. Accordingly, pzsm and pvolkov now return 1 for any q>J and lower.tail=TRUE and zero for lower.tail=FALSE.
* fixes important bugs in AICc

0.2.2 (2015-07-12)
* plotprofmle is now a S4 method with mle2 and profile.mle2 signatures
* Fixed the way \dots are handled by some of the fitting functions
* Better starting values for fitting Weibull distributions

0.2.1 (2015-06-14)
* Fixed some errors in the documentation

0.2.0 (2015-06-01)
* Reworked the Volkov distribution for performance.
* Reworked density, quantile and distribution functions for more consistent behaviour, 
error handling and large performance gains.
* Added some missing functions for mzsm, poig and poix families.
* New function *updatesad* to update a fitsad with better fit from profile.
* *radpred* now uses exact solutions for extreme data points.
* Reimplemented the *AIC* and *AICc* functions for better integration with fitsad and fitrad classes.
* Removed trueLL method to an experimental branch
* Improved grammar and clearer text in some manual pages and vignette.
* Improved starting values for several distributions.
* Replaced table(cut(x)) for hist for improved performance.
* octav and rad classes now have validation functions and are more consistent.
* More informative calls in *show* and *summary*.
* Reduced code redundancy and improved readability.
* Changed some "Depends" and "Imports" to make the package more light-weight, but still reliable
* Fixed the Broken-Stick family to behave like a Discrete distribution.
* Small but importante fixes in *octavpred*.
* Workarounds for bugs and issues of the bbmle package.

0.1.10 (2014-07-02)
* Initial release on CRAN.
